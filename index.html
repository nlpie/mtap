      <p>MTAP is a framework for developing text analysis pipelines. It utilizes the gRPC Framework for communication between independently deployed, scalable, cross-language components.</p>

        <h2>Ease of Use</h2>
        <p>
          MTAP takes care of all the communication between different
          components, and provides a distributed object model for text analysis
          artifacts. All you have to worry about is writing the text analysis
          code.

        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>
          By using the microservice pattern, text analysis components can be
          deployed once and then mixed and matched in different pipelines.
          Components written in different languages can interoperate without
          hassle. We also provide a RESTful API gateway that lets you call
          components using HTTP.

        <h2>Scalability</h2>
        <p>
          MTAP is designed to bridge the gap between prototyping new ideas and
          deploying them into a production environment. It supports calling
          components locally without using any network infastructure all the
          way up to deploying services and using service discovery via
          Consul to build pipelines.
